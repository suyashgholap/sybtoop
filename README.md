# Second Year B.Tech OOP Practical Codes
**1**   Create a class named weather report that holds a daily weather report with data memberâ€Ÿs day_of_month, hightemp, lowtemp, amount_rain and amount_snow. The constructor             initializes the fields with default values: 99 for day_of_month, 999 for hightemp,-999 for low emp and 0 for amount_rain and amount_snow. Include a function that prompts           the user and sets values for each field so that you can override the default values. Write a C++ program that creates a monthly report.
        a) Menu driven program with options to Enter data and Display report
        b) Report Format
        
**2**   Design a C++ Class 'Complex' with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic                   operations of two complex numbers using operator overloading (using either member functions or friend functions).

**3**   Write a Program to Implement a Class STUDENT having Following Members: Data members & Member functions,Accept Name of the student, marks of the student to Compute Total,           Average to Display the Data

**4**   Implement C++ program to implement a base class consisting of the data members such as name of the student, roll number and subject. The derived class consists of the data         members subject code ,internal assessment and university examination marks. The program should have the facilities. 
        i) Build a master table 
        ii) List a table 
        iii) Insert a new entry 
        iv) Delete old entry 
        v) Edit an entry 
        vi) Search for a record. 
        Use virtual functions.
        
**5**   Write a function template selection Sort. Write a program that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and a float array.
