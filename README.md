<h1>Second Year B.Tech OOP Practical Codes</h1>
<h2>List of Topics</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Create a class named weather report that holds a daily weather report with data memberâ€Ÿs day_of_month, hightemp, lowtemp, amount_rain and amount_snow. The constructor initializes the fields with default values: 99 for day_of_month, 999 for hightemp,-999 for low emp and 0 for amount_rain and amount_snow. Include a function that prompt the user and sets values for each field so that you can override the default values. Write a C++ program that creates a monthly report.
        <ul>
            <li>Menu driven program with options to Enter data and Display report</li>
            <li>Report Format </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Design a C++ Class 'Complex' with data members for real and imaginary part. Provide default and parameterized constructors. Write a program to perform arithmetic  operations of two complex numbers using operator overloading (using either member functions or friend functions).
    </li>
    <li>
        Write a Program to Implement a Class STUDENT having Following Members: Data members & Member functions,Accept Name of the student, marks of the student to Compute Total, Average to Display the Data
    </li>
    <li>
       Implement C++ program to implement a base class consisting of the data members such as name of the student, roll number and subject. The derived class consists of the data members subject code ,internal assessment and university examination marks. The program should have the facilities.

    <li>
        Develop an object oriented program in C++ /Python to create a database of the personnel information system containing the following information: Name, Date of Birth, Blood group, Height, Weight, Insurance Policy number, Contact address, telephone number, driving licence no. etc Construct the database with suitable member functions for initializing and destroying the data viz constructor, default constructor, copy constructor, destructor, static member functions , friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic memory allocation operators-new and delete.
    </li>
    <li>
         Write a function template selection Sort. Write a program that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and a float array.
    </li>
    <li>
    Create a C++ /Python class named Television that has data members to hold the model number and the screen size in inches, and the price. Member functions include overloaded insertion and extraction operators. If more than four digits are entered for the model, if the screen size is smaller than 12 or greater than 70 inches, or if the price is negative or over $5000 then throw an integer. Write a main() function that instantiates a television object, allows user to enter data and displays the data members .If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with zero values.
    </li>
    <li>
    Write a menu driven program that will create a data file containing the list of telephone numbers in the following form
        John 23456
        Ahmed 9876
        Use a class object to store each set of data, access the file created and implement the following tasks I. Determine the telephone number of specified person II. Determine the name if telephone number is known III. Update the telephone number, whenever there is a change        
    </li>
    <li>
    Write a Python program to calculate salary of an employee given his basic pay (take as input from user). Calculate gross salary of employee. Let HRA be 10 % of basic pay and TA be 5% of basic pay. Let employee pay professional tax as 2% of total salary. Calculate net salary payable after deductions
    </li>
